## Local Development

To preview the site locally, you'll need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed. Then, when you install your Ruby bundle from inside the project folder, this will get you setup with everything you need to preview GitHub pages locally.

Install your Ruby bundle like this:

```shell
bundle install
```

Then, as per the official [GitHub instructions for testing your site locally](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) you will serve the site on your local machine like:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You'll see a confirmation message of the server address where you can view your work locally, something like http://127.0.0.1:4000

Happy hacking!
