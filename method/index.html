<h2>Liquid D&B Ratings</h2>
<p>The majority of selections on BeatWatch are derived by Chris's exhaustive monthly listening to the Beatport new
    releases chart, in order to catch any and all of the best tracks to suit his taste.</p>
<p>Chris's approach to ranking is pure self-test of his own enjoyment, along the following scale:</p>

<style type="text/css">
    .markdown-body table thead tr {
        background-color: #e6e8ea;
    }

        <td>I might appreciate hearing a few parts of the tune.</td>
        <td>I probably appreciate listening to the whole tune.</td>
        <td>I definitely appreciate listening to the whole tune often.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <th>Who would I share these tunes with?</th>
        <td>I wouldn't share these tunes (except as a joke).</td>

        <td>Those who want my "best of the year" tunes.</td>
        <td>Those who want my "best of genre" tunes.</td>
